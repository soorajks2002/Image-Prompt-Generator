# Image Prompter

The Image Prompt Generator is a versatile tool designed to facilitate the creative process for various text-to-image models, including popular ones like Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E, and Midjourney. This tool aims to provide users with a seamless experience in generating image prompts for these models using just a few keywords.

### Key Features

1. **Keyword-Based Prompts :** Users can input a set of keywords or phrases that describe the concept or scene they want to see in the generated images. These keywords will serve as the basis for generating the prompts.

2. **Artistic Style Selection :** One of the unique features of this tool is the ability for users to choose from a variety of art styles for the generated images. Whether it's the elegance of watercolors, the timelessness of classic paintings, or the vibrant world of anime, users can tailor the visual style to their preferences.

3. **Prompt Quantity Control :** Users can specify the number of prompts they wish to generate. Whether they need a single high-quality image prompt or a series of diverse prompts for exploration, the tool can accommodate their requirements.
